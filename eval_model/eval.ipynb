      "Okay, I need to implement BFS in Python. Let me think about how BFS works. So BFS is a graph traversal algorithm that explores all the neighboring nodes at the present depth level before moving on to nodes at the next depth level. It uses a queue data structure to keep track of the nodes to visit next.\n",
      "\n",
      "First, I should decide on the data structure for the graph. Usually, an adjacency list is a good choice. So maybe represent the graph as a dictionary where each key is a node and the value is a list of its neighbors.\n",
      "\n",
      "The BFS function will take the graph and a starting node. Then, I need to keep track of visited nodes to avoid cycles. So a visited set or list would be useful here.\n",
      "\n",
      "The steps are: enqueue the starting node, mark it as visited. Then, while the queue is not empty, dequeue a node, process it (like print or collect), then enqueue all its unvisited neighbors and mark them as visited.\n",
      "\n",
      "Wait, in Python, the standard queue can be implemented with a list using append and pop(0), but that's O(n) time. Alternatively, using collections.deque is more efficient for popping from the front. So maybe import deque from collections.\n",
      "\n",
      "Let me outline the steps:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. Initialize a queue with the start node.\n",
      "2. Mark start node as visited.\n",
      "3. While queue is not empty:\n",
      "   a. Dequeue a node.\n",
      "   b. Process the node.\n",
      "   c. Enqueue all unvisited neighbors.\n",
      "   d. Mark them as visited.\n",
      "\n",
      "So the code structure would look something like:\n",
      "\n",
      "from collections import deque\n",
      "\n",
      "def bfs(graph, start):\n",

      "                queue.append(neighbor)\n",
      "\n",
      "Wait, but what if the graph has nodes that are not connected? The function starts from the given start node, so it's okay. The visited set ensures that each node is processed once.\n",
      "\n",
      "Testing this with a sample graph. Let's say graph is like:\n",
      "\n",
      "graph = {\n",
      "    'A': ['B', 'C'],\n",
      "    'B': ['A', 'D', 'E'],\n",

      "    'F': ['C', 'E']\n",

      "Starting at 'A', the BFS order should be A, B, C, D, E, F.\n",
      "\n",

      "I should also handle cases where the start node is not in the graph. Maybe add a check at the beginning. But the problem statement might not require error handling, just the basic implementation.\n",
      "\n",
      "So the code would be as above. Let me write that properly.\n",
      "\n",
      "Wait, the user might want the function to return the traversal order instead of just printing. Maybe collect the nodes in a list and return it.\n",
      "\n",
      "So modifying the code:\n",

      "def bfs(graph, start):\n",

      "                queue.append(neighbor)\n",
      "    return result\n",
      "\n",
      "That way, the function returns the BFS order.\n",
      "\n",
      "But the user's instruction says \"implement BFS in Python\". So the code should be a function that performs BFS correctly.\n",

      "I should also include a sample usage. But the user might just want the function.\n",

      "Topology is a field of mathematics that examines the intrinsic properties of geometric objects and spaces that remain invariant under continuous transformations. These transformations include stretching, bending, and twisting, but exclude tearing, cutting, or gluing.

      "  - **Connectedness**: Whether a space is in one piece or multiple pieces.\n",
      "  - **Simply Connectedness**: Whether any loop in the space can be shrunk to a point.\n",

      "\n",
      "### Branches of Topology\n",
      "\n",
      "- **Point-Set Topology**: Focuses on the basic properties of spaces such as openness, closedness, compactness, and connectedness.\n",
      "\n",
      "- **Algebraic Topology**: Uses tools from abstract algebra to study topological spaces. It introduces concepts like homotopy (deformation of paths) and homology (studying holes in spaces).\n",

      "\n",
      "Wait, the problem says it's part of SWEbench, so I should probably write a function that takes a graph and a start node, then returns the order of visited nodes. The graph can be represented as an adjacency list, maybe a dictionary where each key is a node and the value is a list of neighbors.\n",
      "\n",
      "Let me outline the steps:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. Initialize a visited set to keep track of visited nodes.\n",
      "2. Use a stack to hold nodes to visit next. Push the start node onto the stack.\n",
      "3. While the stack isn't empty, pop the top node, mark it as visited, and add it to the result list.\n",
      "4. Then, iterate through the neighbors of the current node. For each neighbor that hasn't been visited yet, push it onto the stack. But wait, the order might matter here. Since we're using a stack (LIFO), the last neighbor added will be visited first, which is typical for DFS.\n",
      "\n",
      "Wait, but when adding neighbors, should I add them in reverse order to maintain the original order in traversal? For example, if the adjacency list is [A: [B, C, D]], then pushing B, C, D in order would mean D is processed next because stack is LIFO. So the traversal would be A, D, C, B. But maybe the order in which neighbors are added affects the traversal order. But the problem doesn't specify the order, so perhaps it's acceptable as long as it's a valid DFS.\n",
      "\n",
      "Alternatively, maybe the standard way is to add the neighbors in reverse so that the first neighbor is processed first. Hmm. Let me think. Suppose the adjacency list is ordered as B, C, D. If I push B, then C, then D, the stack becomes [D, C, B]. Then the next pop is B, then its neighbors, etc. So the traversal would be A -> B ->... then C, then D. But if I reverse the order when adding, pushing D, C, B, then the stack would process B first. Wait, no. Wait, when you push B first, then C, then D, the stack is [D, C, B]. So popping gives B first. Wait, no. Wait, the stack is LIFO. So when you push B, then C, then D, the stack is [D, C, B]. So when you pop, you get B first. Then C, then D. So the traversal order would be A, B, then B's neighbors, then C, then C's neighbors, then D. So the order in which you add the neighbors to the stack affects the traversal order. So if the adjacency list is [B, C, D], adding them in that order would result in the stack having D, C, B. So the next node after A is B. But if you reverse the order when adding, you push D first, then C, then B, the stack would be [B, C, D], so popping gives B first. Wait, no. Wait, the order in which you add the neighbors to the stack is important. Let me clarify:\n",
      "\n",
      "Suppose the adjacency list for node A is [B, C, D]. When processing node A, we need to add its neighbors to the stack. If we add them in the order B, C, D, then the stack becomes [B, C, D] (since each is pushed on top). Wait, no. Wait, stack is LIFO. So if you push B, then C, then D, the stack is [D, C, B]. So when you pop, you get B first. Then C, then D. So the traversal order would be A, B, then B's children, then C, then C's children, then D. But if you add the neighbors in reverse order (D, C, B), then the stack becomes [B, C, D], so popping gives D first. So the traversal would be A, D, then D's children, then C, then C's children, then B. So the order in which neighbors are added to the stack affects the traversal order.\n",
      "\n",
      "But in standard DFS implementations, the order depends on the order in which the neighbors are added. Since the problem doesn't specify the order of traversal, perhaps any correct DFS traversal is acceptable.\n",
      "\n",
      "So for the code, perhaps the simplest way is to iterate through the neighbors in their natural order and push them onto the stack. So for each neighbor in the adjacency list, in order, push them onto the stack. Then, when popped, they are processed in reverse order.\n",
      "\n",

So stack after processing A is [B, C, D]. Then next pop is D. So the order would be A, D, then D's neighbors, then C, then C's neighbors, then B. So the traversal order is A, D, B, C. Wait, no.

      "**The Essentials: What to Bring**\n",
      "\n",
      "- **Clothing:**  \n",
      "Pack versatile, layered clothing that can adapt to temperature swings. Lightweight, quick-drying fabrics are ideal for hot desert days, while sweaters and light jackets will keep you comfortable in the evenings, especially in the mountains. Modest attire—covering shoulders and knees—is appreciated in conservative regions and when visiting mosques or local homes.\n",
      "\n",
      "- **Footwear:**  \n",

      "- **Sun & Hydration Gear:**  \n",
      "A broad-spectrum sunscreen, a wide-brimmed hat, and sunglasses will be your best friends against the fierce North African sun. Don’t forget a refillable water bottle to stay hydrated in the dry heat.\n",
      "\n",
      "- **Electronics & Accessories:**  \n",
      "A portable power bank ensures your devices stay charged, especially on longer treks or in areas with limited electricity. A universal power adapter for Morocco’s Type C, D, E, F, and L sockets is a must. For photography enthusiasts, a camera with extra batteries and memory cards will capture the breathtaking landscapes and vibrant culture.\n",

      "- **Personal & Hygiene Items:**  \n",
      "Travel-sized toiletries, a reusable water bottle, and hand sanitizer will keep you fresh and safe. For women, menstrual products and a small first-aid kit are prudent.\n",
